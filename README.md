# Lambda Twitter Commit Bot

This is a fun little bot I made. It takes a portion of the [GitHub Archive](https://www.githubarchive.org/) and uses a [Markoc chain library](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) to generate tweets.

It's not perfect, but it'll do for now.

## TODO

* Handle messages longer than 140 characters (possibly just fetch a new one until we get a string the right size)
* Strip emails, etc out of commits
* Maybe something else
